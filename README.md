# Algorithmic-Toolbox

The solutions are for the course [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox) offered on Coursera. The assignment solutions are in Python3.

The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. My solutions demonstrate solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently.
